            <img src="Jupiter with moons -2.JPG" alt="Jupiter with Moons">
            <p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in our Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. It is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Object Type:</strong> Gas Giant Planet</li>
                <li><strong>Constellation:</strong> Changes as it moves through the zodiac constellations (currently in Taurus as of late 2024/early 2025)</li>
                <li><strong>Magnitude:</strong> Varies, typically between -2.94 and -1.66 (one of the brightest objects in the night sky)</li>
                <li><strong>Size:</strong> Diameter of 139,820 km (86,881 miles)</li>
                <li><strong>Age:</strong> Approximately 4.5 billion years</li>
                <li><strong>J2000 Coordinates:</strong> Varies significantly due to orbital motion.</li>
                <li><strong>Best Time to Observe (Northern Hemisphere):</strong> When it is at or near opposition (when it is closest to Earth and fully illuminated by the Sun). This occurs roughly every 13 months.</li>
                <li><strong>Discoverer:</strong> Known since ancient times; its four largest moons (Io, Europa, Ganymede, Callisto) were discovered by Galileo Galilei in 1610.</li>
                <li><strong>Distance from Earth:</strong> Varies from 588 million km (365 million miles) to 968 million km (601 million miles).</li>

            <div class="fun-facts">
                <h3>Fun Facts:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Jupiter has the shortest day of all the planets, rotating once every 9 hours and 55 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Its Great Red Spot is a giant storm larger than Earth that has been raging for at least 350 years.</li>
                    <li>Jupiter has 95 known moons, with the four largest (Galilean moons) being easily visible with a small telescope.</li>
                    <li>It acts as a "cosmic vacuum cleaner," deflecting or absorbing many comets and asteroids that might otherwise hit inner planets.</li>

            <p>The Andromeda Galaxy (M31) is the closest large spiral galaxy to our Milky Way and is on a collision course with it. It is the most distant object visible to the naked eye under dark sky conditions.</p>

                <li><strong>Object Type:</strong> Spiral Galaxy (SA(s)b)</li>
                <li><strong>Constellation:</strong> Andromeda</li>
                <li><strong>Magnitude:</strong> 3.4 (easily visible with binoculars, sometimes naked eye)</li>
                <li><strong>Size:</strong> Approximately 220,000 light-years in diameter</li>
                <li><strong>Age:</strong> Estimated to be around 10 billion years old.</li>
                <li><strong>J2000 Coordinates:</strong> RA 00h 42m 44.3s | Dec +41Â° 16â€² 09â€³</li>
                <li><strong>Best Time to Observe (Northern Hemisphere):</strong> Autumn (September to November) when it is high in the night sky.</li>
                <li><strong>Discoverer:</strong> First recorded by the Persian astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi in 964 AD. Charles Messier cataloged it as M31 in 1764.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>The Andromeda Galaxy is approaching the Milky Way at about 110 kilometers per second, and they are expected to collide in about 4.5 billion years.</li>
                    <li>It contains about 1 trillion stars, roughly twice the number of stars in the Milky Way.</li>
                    <li>Despite its immense size, only its bright core is visible to the naked eye.</li>
                    <li>The collision with the Milky Way is not expected to destroy either galaxy but will form a new, larger elliptical galaxy often dubbed "Milkomeda."</li>

            <p>Comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) is a long-period comet discovered in 2023. It garnered significant attention due to its potential to become a bright, naked-eye comet in late 2024. Its brightness depends heavily on its perihelion passage and how much dust and gas it expels.</p>

                <li><strong>Object Type:</strong> Long-Period Comet</li>
                <li><strong>Constellation:</strong> Changes significantly over time due to its orbit. (In this image, it would be in a specific constellation on Nov 05 2024)</li>
                <li><strong>Magnitude:</strong> Highly variable, can range from very faint to potentially naked-eye brightness (e.g., predicted to be around magnitude 0-2 in October 2024).</li>
                <li><strong>Size:</strong> Nucleus size typically a few kilometers (e.g., estimated 2-10 km). Coma and tail can extend millions of kilometers.</li>
                <li><strong>Age:</strong> Formed with the Solar System, approximately 4.5 billion years.</li>
                <li><strong>J2000 Coordinates:</strong> Constantly changing due to orbital motion.</li>
                <li><strong>Best Time to Observe (Northern Hemisphere):</strong> Predicted to be best in October 2024, after perihelion and before closest approach to Earth.</li>

            <p>The Blinking Planetary Nebula (NGC 6826 or Caldwell 15) is a planetary nebula in the constellation Cygnus. It gets its popular name from the optical illusion that makes it appear to "blink" when viewed through a small telescope: the bright central star is so luminous that it overwhelms the surrounding nebula when viewed directly, but the nebula becomes visible with averted vision.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The "blinking" effect is due to the contrast between the bright central star and the fainter nebula, and how our eyes perceive light differently with direct versus averted vision.</li>
                    <li>NGC 6826 features two distinct bright patches, known as FLIERS (Fast Low-Ionization Emission Regions), which are moving outwards at supersonic speeds.</li>
                    <li>The central star is an O-type star, which is extremely hot and luminous, driving a fast stellar wind that shapes the nebula.</li>

            <p>The Flame Nebula (NGC 2024 or Sh2-277) is a large emission nebula located in the constellation Orion, part of the larger Orion Molecular Cloud Complex. It is illuminated by the powerful ultraviolet radiation from a hot, young O-type star within its core, and its dark lanes of dust give it a fiery, flame-like appearance.</p>

            <p>NGC 1569 is a dwarf irregular galaxy located in the constellation Camelopardalis. It is a famous starburst galaxy, undergoing an exceptionally high rate of star formation, about 100 times faster than our Milky Way. This intense activity has been almost continuous for the past 100 million years, leading to the formation of massive star clusters.</p>
